# English-to-French Neural Machine Translation (NMT)

This project implements a **Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model** for translating **English to French** using a **Seq2Seq architecture with LSTM**. The model is enhanced with **Bahdanau Attention**, allowing it to focus on relevant words during translation, significantly improving accuracy. The implementation is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and evaluated using the **BLEU score** to measure translation quality.

## Technologies Used  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Python
